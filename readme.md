# About

Hello and welcome! Here you'll find the slides + exercise file + data for the workshop I had at Codiax 2021 [1].

Name of workshop: Matching Journalists with Domain Experts: Text Classification with BERT and Gradient Boosting Trees from Idea to Production

Abstract: We’ll start with a real world challenge: matching journalists interested in writing a story with relevant domain experts. We’ll examine the use case, convert it into a technical one and discuss a baseline approach. We’ll then work on implementing a better and smarter solution, using a combination of Machine Learning algorithms. We’ll discuss performance, pros and cons, as well as future steps.

# Project setup

Use Python 3.7+

Install requirements
```
sudo apt install cmake

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser should then open the jupyter notebook interface. In it, click on exercise.ipynb, then run the first cell (click on it and press shift+enter) to make sure everything's up and running. Similarly, open slides.ipynb for the slides + notes. The slides are written using the RISE extension for jupyter notebook [2]. Hit alt+r to start the slideshow, then hit t to also see the notes.
